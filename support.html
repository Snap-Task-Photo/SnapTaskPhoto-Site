    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <!-- Getting Started -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I capture photos with the app?</h3>
            <p>Open the app and you'll see the SNAP screen with purpose buttons: Task, Text, Food, Identify, Slide, or Idea. Tap what you're capturing, take the photo, and it goes directly to your iCloud Drive — never touching your Camera Roll. This keeps task photos separate from your memories.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Where are my photos stored?</h3>
            <p>Photos are stored in your iCloud Drive in a "SnapTaskPhoto" folder. You can see them in the Files app under iCloud Drive → SnapTaskPhoto. This means your photos are backed up automatically, sync across your devices, and won't be lost if you delete the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens if I delete the app?</h3>
            <p>Your photos stay safe in iCloud Drive. Reinstall the app anytime and they'll be right where you left them. You can also access them directly through the Files app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do photos sync across my devices?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Photos are stored in iCloud Drive, so they automatically sync to any device signed into the same Apple ID with iCloud Drive enabled.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Using the App -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Using the App</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I process my photos?</h3>
            <p>Tap the Unfiled tab to see new photos in a grid. Tap any photo to open details where you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Run AI analysis (Task, Text, Food, Identify, or Slide)</li>
                <li><strong>Share:</strong> Send to Reminders, Things 3, or other apps</li>
                <li><strong>Folder:</strong> Move to a folder for organization</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove the photo</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I create a Reminder from a photo?</h3>
            <p>Open any photo and tap Share. Select Reminders from the share sheet. The reminder includes a deep link back to the photo so you can tap it to see what you need to do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why can't I add images to Reminders?</h3>
            <p>Images in Reminders require the upgraded iCloud Reminders format. To upgrade, open the Reminders app — if prompted, tap "Upgrade." You can also check Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → See All → Reminders. This is a one-time iCloud account upgrade.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens to my Reminder link if I delete the photo?</h3>
            <p>Deep links are preserved. When you delete a photo, it moves to the Deleted folder rather than being permanently removed. The link in your Reminder will still work. You can permanently purge deleted photos in Settings when you're sure you don't need them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I crop photos?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Open a photo and tap Crop. Note that cropping is permanent — it replaces the original image. The app will warn you before cropping.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Folders & Organization -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Folders & Organization</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do folders work?</h3>
            <p>New photos land in the <strong>Unfiled</strong> folder. This is your triage space — review photos, run AI analysis, share to Reminders, then move to an organized folder when ready. The Folders tab shows all 11 folders so you can browse everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What folders are available?</h3>
            <p>11 folders are available: Unfiled, Receipts, Food Log, Cards, Reference, Medical, Travel, Home, Work, Project, and Other. If your list feels too long, you can hide folders you don't need in Settings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What's the difference between moving to a folder and deleting?</h3>
            <p>Moving to a folder keeps the photo in your iCloud Drive for reference — useful for receipts or things you've shared to Reminders. Delete moves it to a Deleted folder where you can recover it later or permanently remove it to free up space.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Photo Gallery Cleanup -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Photo Gallery Cleanup</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does Photo Gallery Cleanup do?</h3>
            <p>The Roll tab lets you triage your Camera Roll to separate task photos from memories. View your photos in a grid and decide what to do with each one:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Move:</strong> Import to Unfiled, open Photo Details, then delete from Camera Roll</li>
                <li><strong>Copy:</strong> Import to Unfiled, open Photo Details, but keep in Camera Roll</li>
                <li><strong>Keep:</strong> Mark as a memory — it won't appear in future cleanups</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove from Camera Roll entirely</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use <strong>Batch Mode</strong> (in the Options menu) if you want Move and Copy to work silently without opening Photo Details — great for rapid processing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What do the filter toggles do?</h3>
            <p>The Options menu has toggles to filter your view:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hide Processed:</strong> Hides photos you've already Move'd or Copy'd</li>
                <li><strong>Hide Kept:</strong> Hides photos you've marked as memories</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both are off by default so you see everything. Turn them on to focus on unreviewed photos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I filter by album?</h3>
            <p>Tap the album filter dropdown in the toolbar (shows "All Photos" by default). You can filter by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>All Photos:</strong> Everything in your Camera Roll</li>
                <li><strong>Not in Album:</strong> Photos not yet organized into any album</li>
                <li><strong>Any album:</strong> View just one album at a time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I add a photo to an album?</h3>
            <p>Open any photo and tap the <strong>Album</strong> button. You'll see a list of your existing albums plus a "New Album..." option. Tap an album to add the photo, or create a new one. The photo stays in your Camera Roll — albums are just groupings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I manage my albums?</h3>
            <p>Tap the gear icon next to the album filter dropdown to open <strong>Manage Albums</strong>. From there you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Create:</strong> Tap "New Album..." and enter a name</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Swipe left on any album and tap Delete</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Only albums you created can be deleted — smart albums like Favorites and Screenshots are managed by iOS. Remember: deleting an album doesn't delete the photos inside it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Will cleanup affect my original photos?</h3>
            <p>Move and Copy create a downsized copy in the app (optimized for storage). If you choose Move, the original is deleted from your Camera Roll but recoverable in your Recently Deleted album for 30 days. Keep and Delete only affect Camera Roll — they don't copy anything to the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much are photos compressed?</h3>
            <p>Photos are automatically resized to 1200px on the longest edge and saved as 75% quality JPEG. A typical 20MB HDR photo becomes roughly 200-400KB — small enough to email, text, or share anywhere. Your original stays untouched in your Camera Roll if you use Copy instead of Move.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Understanding Your Camera Roll -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Understanding Your Camera Roll</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Albums are like playlists, not folders</h3>
            <p>Your photos always live in your main Library. Albums are just groupings — like music playlists. The same photo can be in multiple albums at once (Vacation, Favorites, and Best of 2024, for example). Moving a photo to an album doesn't move it anywhere — it just adds a reference.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Deleting an album doesn't delete photos</h3>
            <p>When you delete an album, you're only removing the grouping. The photos stay in your Library and any other albums they belong to. It's like deleting a playlist — the songs don't disappear from your music library.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does "Not in Any Album" mean?</h3>
            <p>These are photos in your Library that haven't been added to any album yet — they're unorganized but not lost. Use SnapTaskPhoto's album filter to find and organize them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Recently Deleted: your safety net</h3>
            <p>When you delete a photo from your Camera Roll, it moves to Recently Deleted and stays there for 30 days. You can recover it anytime during that window. After 30 days, it's permanently removed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What about folders?</h3>
            <p>Apple's Photos app lets you create folders to group related albums (like a Travel folder containing Italy, Japan, and France albums). SnapTaskPhoto can see albums inside folders — they appear in your album list just like any other album. However, when you create a new album from SnapTaskPhoto, it goes to the root level. This is an Apple limitation — there's no way for apps to create albums inside folders.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- AI Analysis -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>AI Analysis</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are the different AI analysis modes?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Infers actionable task titles from the photo. Best for "what do I need to do?" situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Text:</strong> Extracts all visible text verbatim. Best for documents and receipts. Non-English text is automatically translated.</li>
                <li><strong>Food:</strong> Identifies meals and estimates carbs and calories for tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Identify:</strong> Identifies plants, pets, antiques, collectibles, and more. Includes value estimates where applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide:</strong> Summarizes conference slides and presentations into key takeaways.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What can Identify mode recognize?</h3>
            <p>Almost anything! Plants (species, care tips), pets (breed, age estimate), antiques, collectibles, electronics, furniture, artwork, coins, stamps, vintage items, and more. You'll get identification details plus a rough value estimate where applicable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does the app do text recognition without AI?</h3>
            <p>Yes. The app automatically runs on-device text recognition (OCR) when you capture or import photos. This is free, instant, and completely private — nothing leaves your device. The AI analysis is an optional extra that provides smarter, contextual descriptions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does the AI analysis send my photos to the cloud?</h3>
            <p>Only if you use the AI analysis feature. When you tap "Task" or "Text" to analyze, the photo is sent securely to generate a smart description. This is optional — on-device recognition and manual notes work without any cloud connection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are the free tier limits?</h3>
            <p>You get 30 free AI analyses to try it out — this is a one-time trial, not monthly. All other features — capture, organization, sharing, on-device text recognition — are unlimited and free forever. After using your 30 trial analyses, upgrade to Pro for more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does Pro include?</h3>
            <p>Pro gives you 200 AI analyses per month. That's more than 6 per day — plenty for most users. Your monthly count resets on the 1st. Cancel anytime — your photos stay in iCloud Drive regardless of subscription status. See pricing on the <a href="index.html">main page</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How accurate are the AI estimates (food, value)?</h3>
            <p>AI estimates for carbohydrates, item valuations, and other analyses are <strong>for fun and informational purposes only</strong>. They may be inaccurate or misleading. Don't use them for medical decisions, dietary planning, buying/selling decisions, or insurance purposes. Always consult a nutritionist, appraiser, or other qualified professional for important decisions.</p>

    <!-- Privacy & Permissions -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Privacy & Permissions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Photos are stored in your personal iCloud Drive — we never see them. On-device text recognition runs entirely on your phone. AI analysis is optional and processed without storing your photos. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What permissions does the app need?</h3>
            <p>All permissions are optional — use what fits your workflow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Capture photos directly to Files, bypassing your Camera Roll. Skip this if you only want to import from Camera Roll.</li>
                <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> Access Camera Roll for Photo Gallery Cleanup. Skip this if you only want to capture with the in-app camera.</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Tag photos with where they were captured. Photos display the city/town name (e.g., "Boston 17Jan") so you know at a glance where you took them. Completely optional.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can change permissions anytime in Settings → SnapTaskPhoto.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why does the app need photo library access?</h3>
            <p>Photo library access is only needed for Photo Gallery Cleanup, which lets you import from or delete photos in your Camera Roll. The main capture feature works without it — photos go directly to iCloud Drive.</p>
        </div>
