    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <!-- Getting Started -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I capture photos with the app?</h3>
            <p>Tap the camera button to take photos that go directly to your iCloud Drive — they never touch your Camera Roll. This is the fastest way to capture task photos without cluttering your photo library.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Where are my photos stored?</h3>
            <p>Photos are stored in your iCloud Drive in a "SnapTaskPhoto" folder. You can see them in the Files app under iCloud Drive → SnapTaskPhoto. This means your photos are backed up automatically, sync across your devices, and won't be lost if you delete the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens if I delete the app?</h3>
            <p>Your photos stay safe in iCloud Drive. Reinstall the app anytime and they'll be right where you left them. You can also access them directly through the Files app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do photos sync across my devices?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Photos are stored in iCloud Drive, so they automatically sync to any device signed into the same Apple ID with iCloud Drive enabled.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Using the App -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Using the App</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I process my photos?</h3>
            <p>In grid view, you can see all your photos at a glance. Tap any photo to open details where you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Edit:</strong> Add or modify notes and title</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Run AI analysis (Task, Text, Food, or ID & Value)</li>
                <li><strong>Share:</strong> Send to Reminders, Things 3, or other apps</li>
                <li><strong>Archive:</strong> Move to a folder for reference</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove the photo</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I create a Reminder from a photo?</h3>
            <p>Open any photo and tap Share. Select Reminders from the share sheet. The reminder includes a deep link back to the photo so you can tap it to see what you need to do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why can't I add images to Reminders?</h3>
            <p>Images in Reminders require the upgraded iCloud Reminders format. To upgrade, open the Reminders app — if prompted, tap "Upgrade." You can also check Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → See All → Reminders. This is a one-time iCloud account upgrade.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens to my Reminder link if I delete the photo?</h3>
            <p>Deep links are preserved. When you delete a photo, it moves to the Deleted folder rather than being permanently removed. The link in your Reminder will still work. You can permanently purge deleted photos in Settings when you're sure you don't need them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I crop photos?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Open a photo and tap Crop. Note that cropping is permanent — it replaces the original image. The app will warn you before cropping.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Folders & Organization -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Folders & Organization</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do folders work?</h3>
            <p>Photos flow through two main areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inbox:</strong> A flat triage space for new photos. No subfolders — just capture and process quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Archive:</strong> Organized folders for reference. Choose a folder when you archive (Receipts, Cards, Medical, Travel, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This keeps your Inbox clean for action while Archive becomes your organized reference library.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What folders are available?</h3>
            <p>All folders are available from the start: Unfiled, Receipts, Food Log, Cards, Reference, Medical, Travel, Home, Work, and Other. If your list feels too long, you can hide folders you don't need in Settings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What's the difference between Archive and Delete?</h3>
            <p>Archive keeps the photo in your iCloud Drive for reference — useful for receipts or things you've shared to Reminders. Delete moves it to a Deleted folder where you can recover it later or permanently remove it to free up space.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Photo Gallery Cleanup -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Photo Gallery Cleanup</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does Photo Gallery Cleanup do?</h3>
            <p>Photo Gallery Cleanup lets you triage your Camera Roll to separate task photos from memories. View your photos in a grid and decide what to do with each one:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Move:</strong> Import to Inbox and delete from Camera Roll (batch later)</li>
                <li><strong>Copy:</strong> Import to Inbox but keep in Camera Roll</li>
                <li><strong>Act:</strong> Import and immediately open Photo Details to Share, Archive, or Analyze</li>
                <li><strong>Keep:</strong> Mark as a memory — it won't appear in future cleanups</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove from Camera Roll entirely</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does "Hide Kept Photos" do?</h3>
            <p>The "Hide Kept Photos" toggle filters out photos you've already marked as memories. Turn it on to focus only on photos you haven't processed yet. Turn it off to see everything in your Camera Roll again.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Will cleanup affect my original photos?</h3>
            <p>Move and Copy create a downsized copy in the app (optimized for storage). If you choose Move, the original is deleted from your Camera Roll but recoverable in your Recently Deleted album for 30 days. Keep and Delete only affect Camera Roll — they don't copy anything to the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much are photos compressed?</h3>
            <p>Photos are automatically resized to 1200px on the longest edge and saved as 75% quality JPEG. A typical 20MB HDR photo becomes roughly 200-400KB — small enough to email, text, or share anywhere. Your original stays untouched in your Camera Roll if you use Copy instead of Move.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- AI Analysis -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>AI Analysis</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What's the difference between Task and Text analysis modes?</h3>
            <p>You can choose your preferred mode in Settings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task mode:</strong> Infers actionable task titles from the photo. Best for "what do I need to do?" situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Text mode:</strong> Extracts all visible text verbatim. Best for documents, receipts, or conference slides where you want every word captured. Non-English text is automatically translated to English.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What can ID & Value identify?</h3>
            <p>Almost anything! Plants (species, care tips), pets (breed, age estimate), antiques, collectibles, electronics, furniture, artwork, coins, stamps, vintage items, and more. You'll get identification details plus a rough value estimate where applicable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does the app do text recognition without AI?</h3>
            <p>Yes. The app automatically runs on-device text recognition (OCR) when you capture or import photos. This is free, instant, and completely private — nothing leaves your device. The AI analysis is an optional extra that provides smarter, contextual descriptions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does the AI analysis send my photos to the cloud?</h3>
            <p>Only if you use the AI analysis feature. When you tap "Task" or "Text" to analyze, the photo is sent securely to generate a smart description. This is optional — on-device recognition and manual notes work without any cloud connection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are the free tier limits?</h3>
            <p>You get 30 free AI analyses to try it out — this is a one-time trial, not monthly. All other features — capture, organization, sharing, on-device text recognition — are unlimited and free forever. After using your 30 trial analyses, upgrade to Pro for more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does Pro include?</h3>
            <p>Pro gives you 200 AI analyses per month for $9.99/month. That's more than 6 per day — plenty for most users. Your monthly count resets on the 1st. Cancel anytime — your photos stay in iCloud Drive regardless of subscription status.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How accurate are the AI estimates (food, value)?</h3>
            <p>AI estimates for carbohydrates, item valuations, and other analyses are <strong>for fun and informational purposes only</strong>. They may be inaccurate or misleading. Don't use them for medical decisions, dietary planning, buying/selling decisions, or insurance purposes. Always consult a nutritionist, appraiser, or other qualified professional for important decisions.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Privacy & Permissions -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Privacy & Permissions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Photos are stored in your personal iCloud Drive — we never see them. On-device text recognition runs entirely on your phone. AI analysis is optional and processed without storing your photos. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What permissions does the app need?</h3>
            <p>All permissions are optional — use what fits your workflow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Capture photos directly to Files, bypassing your Camera Roll. Skip this if you only want to import from Camera Roll.</li>
                <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> Access Camera Roll for Photo Gallery Cleanup. Skip this if you only want to capture with the in-app camera.</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Tag photos with where they were captured. Completely optional.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can change permissions anytime in Settings → SnapTaskPhoto.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why does the app need photo library access?</h3>
            <p>Photo library access is only needed for Photo Gallery Cleanup, which lets you import from or delete photos in your Camera Roll. The main capture feature works without it — photos go directly to iCloud Drive.</p>
        </div>
