    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I capture photos with the app?</h3>
        <p>Use the in-app camera to take photos that go directly to your iCloud Drive — they never touch your Camera Roll. This is the fastest way to capture task photos without cluttering your photo library.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Where are my photos stored?</h3>
        <p>Photos are stored in your iCloud Drive in a "SnapTaskPhoto" folder. You can see them in the Files app under iCloud Drive → SnapTaskPhoto. This means your photos are backed up automatically, sync across your devices, and won't be lost if you delete the app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens if I delete the app?</h3>
        <p>Your photos stay safe in iCloud Drive. Reinstall the app anytime and they'll be right where you left them. You can also access them directly through the Files app.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I create a Reminder from a photo?</h3>
        <p>Open any photo, double-tap to share, and select Reminders. The reminder includes a link back to the photo so you can tap it to see what you need to do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the difference between Archive and Delete?</h3>
        <p>Archive keeps the photo in your iCloud Drive for reference — useful for receipts or things you've shared to Reminders. Delete moves it to a Deleted folder where you can recover it later or permanently remove it to free up space.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why does the app ask for location permission?</h3>
        <p>Location permission is optional. If granted, the app tags photos with where they were captured — helpful for remembering where you saw something. You can use the app without granting location permission.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do photos sync across my devices?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Photos are stored in iCloud Drive, so they automatically sync to any device signed into the same Apple ID with iCloud Drive enabled.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Photos are stored in your personal iCloud Drive — we never see them. The app can use AI to analyze photos and suggest descriptions, but this is optional. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What does Gallery Triage do?</h3>
        <p>Gallery Triage lets you swipe through your Camera Roll to quickly sort photos. Move task photos to the app, keep memories in your library, or delete what you don't need. It's the fastest way to clean up your Camera Roll.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Does the AI analysis send my photos to the cloud?</h3>
        <p>Only if you use the AI analysis feature. When you tap "Analyze," the photo is sent securely to generate a smart description. This is optional — you can skip it and add your own notes instead.</p>
    </div>
