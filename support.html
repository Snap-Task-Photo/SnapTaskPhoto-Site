    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <!-- Getting Started -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I capture photos with the app?</h3>
            <p>Open the app and you'll see the SNAP screen with 7 capture intents plus a No AI option: Task, Read, Receipt, Food, Mystery, Slide, or Reference. Tap what you're capturing, take the photo, and it goes directly to your iCloud Drive — never touching your Camera Roll. Photos auto-file to folders based on the intent you choose.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Where are my photos stored?</h3>
            <p>Photos are stored in your iCloud Drive in a "SnapTaskPhoto" folder. You can see them in the Files app under iCloud Drive → SnapTaskPhoto. This means your photos are backed up automatically, sync across your devices, and won't be lost if you delete the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens if I delete the app?</h3>
            <p>Your photos stay safe in iCloud Drive. Reinstall the app anytime and they'll be right where you left them. You can also access them directly through the Files app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do photos sync across my devices?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Photos are stored in iCloud Drive, so they automatically sync to any device signed into the same Apple ID with iCloud Drive enabled.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Using the App -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Using the App</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I process my photos?</h3>
            <p>Tap the Unfiled tab to see new photos in a grid. Tap any photo to open details where you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Run AI analysis (Task, Text, Receipt, Food, Mystery, Slide, or Reference)</li>
                <li><strong>Share:</strong> Send to Reminders, Things 3, or other apps</li>
                <li><strong>Folder:</strong> Move to a folder for organization</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove the photo</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I create a Reminder from a photo?</h3>
            <p>Open any photo and tap Share. Select Reminders from the share sheet. The reminder includes a deep link back to the photo so you can tap it to see what you need to do.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why can't I add images to Reminders?</h3>
            <p>Images in Reminders require the upgraded iCloud Reminders format. To upgrade, open the Reminders app — if prompted, tap "Upgrade." You can also check Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → See All → Reminders. This is a one-time iCloud account upgrade.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What happens to my Reminder link if I delete the photo?</h3>
            <p>Deep links are preserved. When you delete a photo, it moves to the Deleted folder rather than being permanently removed. The link in your Reminder will still work. You can permanently purge deleted photos in Settings when you're sure you don't need them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I crop photos?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Open a photo and tap Crop. Note that cropping is permanent — it replaces the original image. The app will warn you before cropping.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is Batch Mode?</h3>
            <p>Batch Mode keeps you in the camera for rapid capture. After taking a photo, you stay in camera view instead of jumping to details — great for snapping multiple receipts, slides, or items quickly. Toggle it in the camera options.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is Auto-AI?</h3>
            <p>Auto-AI automatically runs AI analysis when you capture a photo. Turn it off if you want to capture quickly and analyze later, or if you're conserving AI credits. You can always analyze photos manually from the detail view.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Folders & Organization -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Folders & Organization</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do folders work?</h3>
            <p>Photos auto-file to folders based on your capture mode: Task photos go to Tasks, Food photos go to Food, etc. You can also manually move photos between folders. The Folders tab shows all your folders so you can browse everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What folders are available?</h3>
            <p>There are 6 default folders: <strong>Unfiled</strong> (landing spot for quick captures), <strong>Tasks</strong> (actionable to-dos), <strong>Receipt</strong> (expenses, returns, purchases), <strong>Food</strong> (meal tracking), <strong>Slides</strong> (presentations and whiteboards), and <strong>Reference</strong> (IDs, cards, permanent lookup items). You can also create custom folders in the Files app (iCloud Drive → SnapTaskPhoto → Archive) and they'll appear automatically in the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What's the difference between moving to a folder and deleting?</h3>
            <p>Moving to a folder keeps the photo in your iCloud Drive for reference — useful for receipts or things you've shared to Reminders. Delete moves it to a Deleted folder where you can recover it later or permanently remove it to free up space.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Photo Gallery Cleanup -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>Photo Gallery Cleanup</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does Photo Gallery Cleanup do?</h3>
            <p>The Roll tab lets you triage your Camera Roll to separate task photos from memories. View your photos in a grid and decide what to do with each one:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Move:</strong> Import to Unfiled, open Photo Details, then delete from Camera Roll</li>
                <li><strong>Copy:</strong> Import to Unfiled, open Photo Details, but keep in Camera Roll</li>
                <li><strong>Keep:</strong> Mark as a memory — it won't appear in future cleanups</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove from Camera Roll entirely</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Use <strong>Batch Mode</strong> (in the Options menu) if you want Move and Copy to work silently without opening Photo Details — great for rapid processing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What do the filter toggles do?</h3>
            <p>The Options menu has toggles to filter your view:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hide Processed:</strong> Hides photos you've already Move'd or Copy'd</li>
                <li><strong>Hide Kept:</strong> Hides photos you've marked as memories</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both are off by default so you see everything. Turn them on to focus on unreviewed photos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I filter by album?</h3>
            <p>Tap the album filter dropdown in the toolbar (shows "All Photos" by default). You can filter by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>All Photos:</strong> Everything in your Camera Roll</li>
                <li><strong>Not in Album:</strong> Photos not yet organized into any album</li>
                <li><strong>Any album:</strong> View just one album at a time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I add a photo to an album?</h3>
            <p>Open any photo and tap the <strong>Album</strong> button. You'll see a list of your existing albums plus a "New Album..." option. Tap an album to add the photo, or create a new one. The photo stays in your Camera Roll — albums are just groupings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I create a new album?</h3>
            <p>Tap the album filter dropdown and select <strong>New Album...</strong>. Enter a name and the album is created. You'll automatically switch to viewing the new album.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I delete an album?</h3>
            <p>First, filter to the album you want to delete. Then tap the options menu (⋯) and select <strong>Delete Album</strong>. This option only appears when viewing a user-created album — smart albums like Favorites and Screenshots are managed by iOS. Remember: deleting an album doesn't delete the photos inside it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Will cleanup affect my original photos?</h3>
            <p>Move and Copy create a downsized copy in the app (optimized for storage). If you choose Move, the original is deleted from your Camera Roll but recoverable in your Recently Deleted album for 30 days. Keep and Delete only affect Camera Roll — they don't copy anything to the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much are photos compressed?</h3>
            <p>Photos are automatically resized to 1200px on the longest edge and saved as 75% quality JPEG. A typical 20MB HDR photo becomes roughly 200-400KB — small enough to email, text, or share anywhere. Your original stays untouched in your Camera Roll if you use Copy instead of Move.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- What Happens to My Photos -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>What Happens to My Photos?</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Nothing is permanently deleted without your control</h3>
            <p>We designed the app to be safe with your photos. Every deletion has a recovery window, and you always control when something is permanently removed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Move (from Roll)</h3>
            <p>Creates a downsized copy in the app, then deletes the original from your Camera Roll. The deleted original goes to iOS Recently Deleted where you can recover it for 30 days.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Copy (from Roll)</h3>
            <p>Creates a downsized copy in the app. Your original stays untouched in your Camera Roll at full resolution.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Delete (from Roll)</h3>
            <p>Removes the photo from your Camera Roll. It goes to iOS Recently Deleted where you can recover it for 30 days before permanent removal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Delete (in app)</h3>
            <p>Moves the photo to a Deleted folder in your iCloud Drive (SnapTaskPhoto/Deleted). It stays there until you permanently purge it from Settings. Deep links to the photo still work while it's in Deleted.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>About downsizing</h3>
            <p>Photos are resized to 1200px max and compressed to ~200-400KB. This is optimized for sharing via email, text, and task apps — not for high-resolution printing or archival. If you need the full-resolution original, use Copy instead of Move so it stays in your Camera Roll.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Understanding Your iCloud Storage -->

        <h2>Understanding Your iCloud Storage</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>You own your data</h3>
            <p>Photos are stored in iCloud Drive under the SnapTaskPhoto folder. Browse them anytime in the Files app (iPhone) or Finder (Mac). They're your files — backed up, synced, and accessible even if you uninstall the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>File structure: two files per photo</h3>
            <p>Each photo has two files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>.jpg</strong> — the image itself</li>
                <li><strong>.json</strong> — metadata (notes, AI analysis, location, share history)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example: <code>20260118_143022_a1b2.jpg</code> and <code>20260118_143022_a1b2.json</code></p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Simple folder structure</h3>
            <p>Photos go directly into 6 folders at the top level of your SnapTaskPhoto storage. No subfolders. No nested complexity. You can create additional folders at the same level in the Files app — they appear automatically in the app.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>The 6 folders explained</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unfiled</strong> — Landing spot for quick captures, Read, and Mystery results</li>
                <li><strong>Tasks</strong> — Photos with actionable to-dos</li>
                <li><strong>Receipt</strong> — Expenses, returns, purchases</li>
                <li><strong>Food</strong> — Meals with carb/calorie estimates</li>
                <li><strong>Slides</strong> — Presentation slides and whiteboard captures</li>
                <li><strong>Reference</strong> — IDs, cards, passwords — permanent lookup items</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>The 8 capture options</h3>
            <p>When you tap SNAP, you choose what you're capturing. This determines where it's filed and (if Auto-AI is on) how it's analyzed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task</strong> — Infers actionable task titles → files to Tasks</li>
                <li><strong>Read</strong> — Extracts all visible text (OCR) → files to Unfiled</li>
                <li><strong>Receipt</strong> — Extracts vendor, date, total → files to Receipt</li>
                <li><strong>Food</strong> — Identifies meals, estimates carbs/calories → files to Food</li>
                <li><strong>Mystery</strong> — Identifies unknown items and estimated value → files to Unfiled</li>
                <li><strong>Slide</strong> — Summarizes key points from presentations → files to Slides</li>
                <li><strong>Reference</strong> — Extracts key details from documents/cards → files to Reference</li>
                <li><strong>No AI</strong> — Quick capture without AI analysis → files to Unfiled</li>
            </ul>

    <!-- AI Analysis -->
    <div class="faq-section">
        <h2>AI Analysis</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are the different AI analysis modes?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Infers actionable task titles from the photo. Best for "what do I need to do?" situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Text:</strong> Extracts all visible text verbatim. Best for documents and receipts. Non-English text is automatically translated.</li>
                <li><strong>Receipt:</strong> Extracts vendor, date, total amount, and key line items from receipts and invoices.</li>
                <li><strong>Food:</strong> Identifies meals and estimates carbs and calories for tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Mystery:</strong> Identifies unknown items and estimated value — vehicles, electronics, art, antiques, plants, pets, collectibles.</li>
                <li><strong>Slide:</strong> Summarizes conference slides and presentations into key takeaways.</li>
                <li><strong>Reference:</strong> Extracts key information from documents and cards — names, numbers, dates, expiration, issuers, and other details for easy lookup.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What can Mystery mode identify?</h3>
            <p>Almost anything! Plants (species, care tips), pets (breed, age estimate), vehicles, electronics, antiques, collectibles, furniture, artwork, coins, stamps, vintage items, and more. You'll get identification details plus a rough value estimate where applicable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does the app do text recognition without AI?</h3>
            <p>Yes. The app automatically runs on-device text recognition (OCR) when you capture or import photos. This is free, instant, and completely private — nothing leaves your device. The AI analysis is an optional extra that provides smarter, contextual descriptions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does the AI analysis send my photos to the cloud?</h3>
            <p>Only if you use the AI analysis feature. When you tap an analysis mode, the photo is sent securely to generate a smart description. This is optional — on-device recognition and manual notes work without any cloud connection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are the free tier limits?</h3>
            <p>You get 15 free AI analyses to try it out — this is a one-time trial, not monthly. All other features — capture, organization, sharing, on-device text recognition — are unlimited and free forever. After using your 15 trial analyses, upgrade to Pro for more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What does Pro include?</h3>
            <p>Pro ($4.99/month) gives you 50 AI analyses per month. Your monthly count resets on the 1st. Need more? Pro subscribers can buy credit packs (+50 for $4.99). Cancel anytime — your photos stay in iCloud Drive regardless of subscription status.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How accurate is AI analysis?</h3>
            <p><strong>AI analyses are often wildly inaccurate.</strong> Verify everything before acting. Food estimates, item valuations, and other analyses are for entertainment only — not for medical, dietary, or financial decisions. When accuracy matters, consult a qualified professional.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Photos are stored in your personal iCloud Drive — we never see them. On-device text recognition runs entirely on your phone. AI analysis is optional and processed without storing your photos. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What permissions does the app need?</h3>
            <p>All permissions are optional — use what fits your workflow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Capture photos directly to Files, bypassing your Camera Roll. Skip this if you only want to import from Camera Roll.</li>
                <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> Access Camera Roll for Photo Gallery Cleanup. Skip this if you only want to capture with the in-app camera.</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Tag photos with where they were captured. Photos display the city/town name (e.g., "Boston 17Jan") so you know at a glance where you took them. Completely optional.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can change permissions anytime in Settings → SnapTaskPhoto.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why does the app need photo library access?</h3>
            <p>Photo library access is only needed for Photo Gallery Cleanup, which lets you import from or delete photos in your Camera Roll. The main capture feature works without it — photos go directly to iCloud Drive.</p>
