    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of <span class="app-name">SnapTaskPhoto</span> ("the App"), developed by Digital Gemba, LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Use of the App</h2>
    <p>SnapTaskPhoto is a productivity app that allows you to capture and organize photos as task reminders, keeping them separate from your Camera Roll. You may use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms and applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>iCloud Drive Requirement</h2>
    <p>The App requires iCloud Drive to store your photos and data. You are responsible for maintaining an active iCloud account with sufficient storage. We are not responsible for any issues arising from iCloud service availability or your iCloud storage limits.</p>

    <h2>Your Content</h2>
    <p>You retain all rights to the photos and content you create using the App. We do not claim any ownership of your content. All content is stored in your personal iCloud Drive and is not accessible to us.</p>

    <h2>AI Analysis Feature</h2>
    <p>The App offers an optional AI-powered photo analysis feature. When you use this feature, your photo is transmitted to our service for processing. By using this feature, you consent to this transmission. We do not store your photos — they are processed and immediately discarded.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the App to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations</li>
        <li>Infringe on the rights of others</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, modify, or create derivative works of the App</li>
        <li>Use the App in any way that could damage or impair its functionality</li>
        <li>Abuse the AI analysis feature or attempt to circumvent any usage limits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App, including its design, features, and code, is owned by Digital Gemba, LLC and is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the App without our prior written consent.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App integrates with Apple iCloud, Apple Reminders, and Anthropic's Claude AI. Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms and conditions. We are not responsible for the functionality or availability of third-party services.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.</p>
    <p>We do not guarantee that the App will meet your specific requirements or expectations. You use the App at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or other intangible losses resulting from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your use or inability to use the App</li>
        <li>Any errors, bugs, or malfunctions in the App</li>
        <li>Loss of photos or data</li>
        <li>Any third-party services integrated with the App</li>
        <li>iCloud service interruptions or data sync issues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data is stored in your personal iCloud Drive. While iCloud provides backup and sync capabilities, we recommend periodically exporting important photos. We are not responsible for any data loss due to iCloud service issues, account problems, or any other cause.</p>

    <h2>Changes to the App</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App at any time without notice. We are not liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the App.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
