    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2025</p>

    <p><span class="app-name">SnapTaskPhoto</span> — <em>Keep the Muck Out of Your Memories™</em> — ("the App") is developed by Digital Gemba, LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
    <p>SnapTaskPhoto is designed with privacy in mind. Your photos are stored in your personal iCloud Drive — we do not have access to them. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to our servers.</p>

    <h2>Information Stored in Your iCloud Drive</h2>
    <p>The App stores photos and metadata in a "SnapTaskPhoto" folder within your iCloud Drive:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Images you capture with the in-app camera or import from your Camera Roll are stored in your iCloud Drive, not on our servers. Photos captured with the in-app camera go directly to iCloud Drive and never touch your Camera Roll. You can view these files directly in the Files app.</li>
        <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Information about each photo (notes, location, dates) is stored alongside the photos in your iCloud Drive.</li>
        <li><strong>Location data (optional):</strong> If you grant location permission, the App may tag photos with the location where they were captured. This information is stored in your iCloud Drive and is never transmitted to us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AI Image Analysis (Optional)</h2>
    <p>The App offers an optional AI-powered feature to analyze photos and generate descriptions. When you use this feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your photo is sent securely to our cloud service for analysis.</li>
        <li>The analysis is performed using Anthropic's Claude AI.</li>
        <li>We do not store your photos on our servers — they are processed and immediately discarded.</li>
        <li>Only the generated description is returned to your device and stored in your iCloud Drive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This feature is entirely optional. You can add your own descriptions without using AI analysis.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or have access to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your photos or images</li>
        <li>Your location data</li>
        <li>Personal information such as your name, email, or contacts</li>
        <li>Analytics or usage data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App integrates with the following services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple iCloud Drive:</strong> Used to store your photos and data. Subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple Reminders:</strong> Used when you create reminders from photos. Subject to Apple's Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Anthropic Claude AI:</strong> Used for optional photo analysis. Subject to <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthropic's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your photos are stored in your personal iCloud Drive, protected by your Apple ID and Apple's security measures. Data transmitted for AI analysis is encrypted in transit. We do not retain any copies of your photos.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any information from children. All data is stored in the user's personal iCloud Drive.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
